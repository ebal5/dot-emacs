* My Emacs Settings

  It is new my Emacs's setting files.
  I uses package.el so this setting requires Emacs 24.4 >=
  to move completely.
  
  And, some setting in there are functions defined at 
  Emacs 25 >= so there are some settings needs Emacs 25. 
  But, these files are treated the version of Emacs.
  
  Init.el file can run on 24.4 <= because it also treats the 
  version of Emacs. But of course it is not perfect.

** Realization way

   I use package.el wraped by use-package. It downloads packages
   automatically.

*** init-loader

    It loads setting files in designated directory one by one
    in order of numeric (file's prefix number like 01 or 12 
    and so on). I setted the directory to "inits", so some files
    are putted in there.
    
    This package is also downloaded by use-package.
